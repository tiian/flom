FLoM (Free Lock Manager) is an open source and free lock manager designed to
serialize and synchronize shell command execution and custom programs
developed in C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, Python.
Both GitHub https://github.com/tiian/flom and 
SourceForge https://sourceforge.net/projects/flom/ host FLoM source code.
Basic usage examples are in doc/examples directory (default installation path 
is /usr/local/share/doc/flom/examples/)
API documentation is distributed in directory doc/html/ (default installation
path is /usr/local/share/doc/flom/html/) and on the web at http://flom.sourceforge.net/
FLoM is implemented using state of the art reactive programming:
independent non blocking threads reach unparalleled scalability and C language
source code guarantee the best performance. The usage of mutexes is reduced to
trifling functions: FLoM can be considered a "lock free lock manager".

A list of implemented use cases is listed at this URL: 
http://sourceforge.net/p/flom/wiki/FLOM%20by%20examples/
This is a brief list of the available features:
- synchronization of shell commands to avoid conflicts on files, directories,
  abstract resources
- enforcement of command order execution to avoid one command is executed
  before another one
- resource utilization leveling to avoid too many similar tasks run at the
  same time 
- all the synchronization features are available inside a single host or in
  a distributed environment using TCP/IP networking (both IPv4 and IPv6 are
  suppoted)
- an autodiscovery feature is available to reduce deployment complexity in a
  cloud environment (every node at any time may become a "server" for
  the others node)
- easy API (Application Programming Interface) to synchronize your own
  programs with shell executed flom commands. These languages have a ready
  to use binding: C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, Python.
- TLS (Transport Layer Security) support to protect network communication and
  to supply peer to peer mutual authentication based on X.509 certificates
- a large spectrum of different resources:
  1. simple: basic locking using DLM semantic
  2. hierarchical: HFS like semantic
  3. numerical: pools of undifferentiated resources
  4. set: sets of differentiated resources
  5. sequence: arrays of transactional (or non transactional) sequences
  6. timestamp: arrays of unique timestamp sequences

Download the tarball from SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/flom/
and install FLoM using standard GNU build chain: 
    tar xvzf flom-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    cd flom-X.Y.Z
    ./configure
    make
    make
    sudo make install
if you are using a Red Hat derivative you will probably use
    su
    make install
    exit
instead of "sudo make install".
NOTE: sorry for the second make command, but there's a dependency related to
      Java Native Interface (JNI) that dynamically create a file and
      invalidates a dependency.

Take a look to file INSTALL for more details.

Use 
man flom 
to read man page and pick up Internet relevant URLs for FLOM project.

Use
make check
to perform package automatic tests.
NOTE: do *NOT* run tests on a system that's using flom because some tests
      need to kill all FLoM running instances and this is not acceptable if
      you are playing production workloads. DO USE A TEST SYSTEM!
NOTE: tests needs the system is NOT overloaded because they stick on timing
      and timing breaks if the system is overloaded.
NOTE: FLoM must be installed with "sudo make install" before tests can 
      proceed (this is a library path issue...)
NOTE: if you are not interested in C++ API library support, specify
      "--disable-cpp" at configure time; example:
      ./configure --disable-cpp
NOTE: if you are not interested in Java API library support, specify
      "--disable-java" at configure time; example:
      ./configure --disable-java
NOTE: if you are not interested in Perl API library support, specify
      "--disable-perl" at configure time; example:
      ./configure --disable-php
NOTE: if you are not interested in PHP API library support, specify
      "--disable-php" at configure time; example:
      ./configure --disable-php
NOTE: if you are not interested in Python API library support, specify
      "--disable-python" at configure time; example:
      ./configure --disable-python

Issues related to multicast and internal Linux firewalling:
the easiest way is to completely disable the internal firewall with
commands
	systemctl stop firewalld 
	systemctl disable firewalld 
or alternatively
	service ipchains stop
	service iptables stop
	chkconfig ipchains off
	chkconfig iptables off
If you cannot disable the firewall and you want to use FLoM autodiscovery
feature (IP multicast based), you will have to configure the internal
firewall allowing FLoM multicast packets.

If you need some help (usage tricks, hints, etc...) please post a message in
the forum: http://sourceforge.net/p/flom/discussion/
If you think you have discovered a bug, please open an issue here:
https://github.com/tiian/flom/issues
If you avoid to send me an e-mail I will be happy: forum posts and tickets
can be seen by many people and I should not answer the same questions many
times.
