/*
 * This example program shows the basic usage of the FLoM Java package.
 * These are the steps:
 * 0. import org.tiian.flom package
 * 1. create an object of type FlomHandle
 * 2. acquire a lock using method lock()
 * 3. execute the code protected by the acquired lock
 * 4. release the lock using method unlock()
 * 5. release the object: this step is suggested because FlomHandle objects
 *    use native C functions and this method allows the JVM to immediately
 *    release the memory allocated by the C functions
 *
 * Compilation command:
 *     javac -cp @datadir@/@PACKAGE@/java/flom.jar Basic.java
 *
 * Note: this program needs an already started FLoM daemon, for instance:
 *     flom -d -1 -- true
 *     java -Djava.library.path=@libdir@ -cp @datadir@/@PACKAGE@/java/flom.jar:. Basic
 *
 * You might activate tracing if you were interested to understand what's
 * happening:
 *     export FLOM_TRACE_MASK=0x80000
 *     java -Djava.library.path=@libdir@ -cp @datadir@/@PACKAGE@/java/flom.jar:. Basic
