/*
 * This example program shows the usage of libflom API library with
 * a statically allocated handle; it uses a resource set instead of the
 * default resource and displays the name of the element obtained.
 * These are the steps:
 * 0. import org.tiian.flom package
 * 1. create an object of type FlomHandle
 * 2. set custom properties different from default values:
 *    2a. use a different AF_UNIX/PF_LOCAL socket to reach FLoM daemon
 *    2b. specifies a resource name to lock
 * 3. acquire a lock using method lock()
 * 4. execute the code protected by the acquired lock
 * 5. release the lock using method unlock()
 * 6. release the object: this step is suggested because FlomHandle objects
 *    use native C functions and this method allows the JVM to immediately
 *    release the memory allocated by the C functions
 *
 * Compilation command:
 *     javac -cp @datadir@/@PACKAGE@/java/flom.jar Advanced.java
 *
 * Note: this program needs an already started FLoM daemon, for instance:
 *     flom -s /tmp/my_socket_name -d -1 -- true
 *     java -Djava.library.path=@libdir@ -cp @datadir@/@PACKAGE@/java/flom.jar:. Advanced
 *
 * You might activate tracing if you were interested to understand what's
 * happening:
 *     export FLOM_TRACE_MASK=0x80000
 *     java -Djava.library.path=@libdir@ -cp @datadir@/@PACKAGE@/java/flom.jar:. Advanced
