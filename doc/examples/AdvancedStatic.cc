/*
 * This example program shows the usage of libflom API library with
 * a statically allocated handle; it uses a resource set instead of the
 * default resource and displays the name of the element obtained.
 * These are the steps:
 * 1. declare an object of type FlomHandle inside process stack
 * 2. set custom properties different from default values:
 *    2a. use a different AF_UNIX/PF_LOCAL socket to reach FLoM daemon
 *    2b. specifies a resource name to lock
 * 3. acquire a lock using method lock()
 * 4. execute the code protected by the acquired lock
 * 5. release the lock using method unlock()
 *
 * Compilation command:
 *     make -f example_makefile AdvancedStatic
 *
 * Note: this program needs an already started FLoM daemon, for instance:
 * flom -s /tmp/my_socket_name -d -1 -- true
 * ./AdvancedStatic
 *
 * The program itself is not verbose, but you might activate tracing if you
 * were interested to understand what's happen:
 * export FLOM_TRACE_MASK=0x80000
 * ./AvancedStatic
