/*
 * This example program shows the basic usage of libflom API library with
 * a dynamically allocated handle.
 * These are the steps:
 * 1. declare a pointer for type FlomHandle
 * 2. create (allocate) a new handle
 * 3. acquire a lock using method lock()
 * 4. execute the code protected by the acquired lock
 * 5. release the lock using method unlock()
 * 6. delete the handle
 *
 * Compilation command:
 *     make -f example_makefile BasicDynamic
 *
 * Note: this program needs an already started FLoM daemon, for instance:
 * flom -d -1 -- true
 * ./BasicDynamic
 *
 * The program itself is not verbose, but you might activate tracing if you
 * were interested to understand what's happen:
 * export FLOM_TRACE_MASK=0x80000
 * ./BasicDynamic
