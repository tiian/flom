LOG:
	 - 1.3.2 (Unique) sequence resource (API support)

20160501 - 1.3.1 (Unique) sequence resource (command line)
	Implementation of sequence resources:
	_s_<something>[number] for non transactional sequences
	_S_<something>[number] for non transactional sequences
	See use case 18 on the wiki:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/flom/wiki/Use%20Case%2018/

20160425 - 1.3.0
	Removed command line option "--resource-wait", "-w": it was redundant
	and the same result can be obtained with the option
	"--resource-timeout=0", "-o 0". The only difference can be in
	scripting: now the exit code can be 96 or 98 depending from the
	timining between the flom client and the flom daemon.
	Test cases now support systems with a network interface that's not
	"eth0" (for example "ens0").
	Support for Ubuntu 16.04, with the exception of PHP, see also
	https://github.com/tiian/flom/issues/5

20160419 - 1.2.0 IoGaCo, TLS API support for all the supported languages:
	C, C++, Java, PHP, Python. SSL/TLS support is now a completed feature.
	GPL only license.
	Added a new tested platform: CentOS 7.2 (64 bit, KVM).

20160330 - 1.1.2 IoGaCo, TLS support
	New option --unique-id to retrieve the FLoM unique identificator
	New options for TLS support: --tls-certificate,
	--tls-private-key, --tls-ca-certificate, --tls-check-peer-id
	Protocol level changes from 2 to 3

20151126 - 1.1.1 IoGaCo, release of IPv6 improvement
	New option -n, --network-interface to specify the network interface
	that must be used to send packets to an IPv6 link local address

20151117 - 1.1.0 IoGaCo, first release: IPv6 support
	New option --debug-feature to debug some special feature
	IPv6 support; please pay attention to this unresolved bug:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/flom/tickets/2/

20150930 - 1.0.0 Java client library API
	Fixed a bug that could be exploited trying to unlock a resource
	with a name different from the locked one (server side fix).
	API setter methods are ignored if the handle state does not allow the
	change of the property; they return FLOM_RC_API_IMMUTABLE_HANDLE
	warning code if the program needs to check the set operation result.

20150526 - 0.9.3 Python client library API

20150129 - 0.9.2 PHP client library API: flom-php-module (flom.php)
	Added trace append option (--append-trace-file)
	WARNING: flom_handle_lock() changed signature, use
		flom_handle_get_locked_element() to retrieve the locked
		element previously returned by reference
	WARNING: all console messages produced by main.c (flom command) and
	related to warning conditions were moved from stdout to stderr. If your
	automation scripts implement console message parsing, you will have to
	fix them before the usage with this new version. As a rule of thumb,
	it is suggested to use exit code check ($?) instead of console message
	parsing.

20141220 - 0.9.1 C++ client library API: libflom (flom.hh)
	Fixed test case "Use case 3 (2/2)" (there was a synchronization bug)

20141204 - 0.9.0 C client library API: libflom (flom.h)
	Fixed a bug related to negative resource timeouts, for example 
	"-o -100" or "--resource-timeout=-100"
	Fixed this bug: 
	https://sourceforge.net/p/flom/discussion/general/thread/cf59b6dc/

20141003 - 0.7.1 Implemented a garbage collector for hierarchical resources
	Fixed a subtle bug exploited by "-d -1" option on the daemon side when
	a client connected and disconnected without a valid command in the 
	the middle
	Optimized CPU consumption related to idle resources ready to be
	destroyed
	Added "-x, --quiesce-exit" and "-X, --immediate-exit" option

20140722 - 0.7.0 Added "-e, --resource-create" option (see [Resource]/Create)
	Added "requester cant wait" exit code: it's returned especially when
	the command line option "-w, --resource-wait" is set to "no"
	Added "-i, --resource-idle-lifespan" option 
	(see [Resource]/IdleLifespan)
	Communication protocol switched to level=2: this release is incompatible
	with previous releases. You have to update all the installed flom
	utilities if used in a distributed environment.

20140525 - 0.5.2 Added hierarchical resources
	Communication protocol switched to level=1: this release is incompatible
	with previous releases. You have to update all the installed flom
	utilities if used in a distributed environment.
	Garbage collector improved: when a resource is no more useful, the
	memory (and the thread) allocated to manage it is released faster than
	before. This is useful for use cases that intensively allocates new
	resources

20140506 - 0.5.1 Added resource set feature
	Added glib2 version check in configure script; minimum glib-2 version
	is 2.22 due to function g_ptr_array_new_with_free_func

20140421 - 0.5.0 Added numeric resource feature
	Added "-q, --resource-quantity" option (see [Resource]/Quantity)
	fixed some bugs related to testsuite temporization

20140403 - 0.3.2 Fixed a bug related to "hostname -I" used in testsuite
	scripts (some Linux systems use an older version without "-I" option);
	fixed a bug related to [Trace]/CommandTraceFile keywork inside config
	files
	removed '#' from test case titles (it does not work with some m4
	versions)
	added syslog messages and verbose console messages to help debugging 
	network related issued

20140320 - 0.3.1 Fixed a bug related to token "UnicastAddress" inside config
	files
	Added "-D, --discovery-attempts" option (see [Network]/DiscoveryAttempts)
	Added "-I, --discovery-timeout" option (see [Network]/DiscoveryTimeout)
	Added "--discovery-ttl" option (see [Network]/DiscoveryTTL)
	Added "--tcp-keepalive-*" otpions (see [Network]/TcpKeepalive*)

20140309 - 0.3.0 Renamed [Communication] with [Daemon] inside configuration 
	files
	Added "-d, --daemon-lifespan" option (see [Daemon]/Lifespan)
	Added distributed lock manager feature with all related options:
	-a, --unicast-address, -p, --unicast-port, -A, --multicast-address,
	-P, --multicast-port	

20140127 - 0.1.5 implemented lock sharing among two or more users [use case #6]

20140124 - 0.1.4 implemented lock mode semantic as in VMS DLM (Distributed Lock
	Manager) [use case #5]

20140119 - 0.1.3 implemented blocking with timeout behavior 
	(--resource-timeout, -o) [use case #4]

20140115 - 0.1.2 implemented non blocking behavior (--resource-wait, -w)
	[use case #3]

20140104 - 0.1.1 splitted daemon/command trace file; implemented configuration
	files; implemented multiple resources [use case #2]

20131222 - 0.1.0 first release: it implements use case #1 (simple
	serialization)
